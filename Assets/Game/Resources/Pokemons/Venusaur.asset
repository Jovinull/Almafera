  description: "Venusaur is a Grass/Poison Pok\xE9mon and the final evolution of
    Bulbasaur, reached after Ivysaur. The bulb on its back has fully bloomed into
    a large flower that absorbs sunlight and turns it into powerful energy. This
    flower releases a soothing fragrance that attracts other Pok\xE9mon and calms
    those around it, especially after rain. Venusaur is at its strongest under bright
    sunlight and is often seen as a leader in nature, guiding Bulbasaur and Ivysaur
    during their evolution."
