  description: "Blastoise is a large Water-type Pok\xE9mon and the final evolution
    of Squirtle, known for the powerful water cannons mounted on its shell. It can
    fire high-pressure blasts strong enough to pierce steel and use them to launch
    itself forward like a rocket, while its heavy, armored body lets it withstand
    recoil and protect itself and its allies in battle."
