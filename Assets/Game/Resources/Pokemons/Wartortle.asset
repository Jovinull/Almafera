  description: "Wartortle is a Water-type Pok\xE9mon that evolves from Squirtle and
    eventually becomes Blastoise. Its large shell and fluffy, wave-shaped tail help
    it stay balanced while swimming at high speeds, using its ears and tail like
    rudders. Wartortle often hides in water to ambush prey and is said to symbolize
    longevity and good luck, which makes it especially popular among elderly Trainers."
