  description: "Squirtle is a small Water-type Pok\xE9mon and one of the three first
    partner Pok\xE9mon given to new Trainers in Kanto. Its tough turtle-like shell
    protects it from attacks and streamlines its body so it can swim quickly through
    the water. Squirtle can shoot powerful jets of water with great accuracy and
    often retreats into its shell to rest safely when it feels threatened or sleepy."
