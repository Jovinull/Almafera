  description: "Charmander is a small, bipedal Fire-type Pok\xE9mon and one of the
    three first partner Pok\xE9mon offered to new Trainers in Kanto. The flame on
    the tip of its tail has burned since birth and reflects its health and emotions,
    glowing brightly when it is strong and flaring up when it is angry. Charmander
    usually lives in hot, mountainous areas and often gathers in small groups, watching
    over the flames on each other\u2019s tails."
