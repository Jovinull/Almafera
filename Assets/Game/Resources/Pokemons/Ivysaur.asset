  description: "Ivysaur is a Grass/Poison Pok\xE9mon that evolves from Bulbasaur
    and prepares to become Venusaur. The bulb on its back has grown into a large
    pink bud supported by sturdy leaves and a short trunk, making Ivysaur heavier
    and forcing its legs to become strong. As the bud nears blooming, it releases
    a sweet scent and Ivysaur spends long periods basking in sunlight, drawing power
    for both itself and its plant."
