  description: "Charizard is a powerful Fire/Flying-type Pok\xE9mon and the final
    evolution of Charmander, known for its imposing, dragon-like appearance and blazing
    tail flame. It soars through mountains and valleys in search of strong opponents,
    unleashing scorching fire that can melt boulders and even glaciers. As it becomes
    more experienced, its flames burn hotter, sometimes turning blue when it grows
    especially fierce. Despite its fearsome strength, Charizard avoids using its
    full power on weaker foes, showing both pride and control in battle."
